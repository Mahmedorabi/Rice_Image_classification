Rice Image Classification Dataset
This repository contains a dataset of rice images for image classification tasks. The dataset can be used to train and evaluate machine learning models for various applications, such as:

Rice variety classification (e.g., Basmati, Jasmine, Arborio)
Dataset Description:

The dataset is comprised of images of rice grains and/or rice plants. Each image is labeled with a corresponding class (e.g., rice variety, quality grade). The specific details of the dataset will be further elaborated upon in the dataset_info.txt file.

Data Format:

The images are stored in a folder structure. Each subfolder represents a specific class, and the images within that folder belong to that class. The file format of the images will be specified in the dataset_info.txt file (e.g., JPEG, PNG).


Explore the dataset:

The images are located in the data folder.
Refer to dataset_info.txt for details about the class labels, image format, and any additional information.
Preprocess the data (if necessary):

You may need to preprocess the data depending on your specific needs and machine learning model. This might involve resizing images, converting color spaces, or data augmentation.

Train your model:

Use the provided dataset to train your image classification model. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets for optimal model performance evaluation.

Evaluate your model:

Evaluate your trained model's performance on the test set using relevant metrics like accuracy
